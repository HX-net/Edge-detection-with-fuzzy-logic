# Edge-detection-with-fuzzy-logic
Hello
In this program, using fuzzy logic, we want to create an improved algorithm for identifying the edge in images (of course, this code does not lead to an improved algorithm for identifying the edge, because the fuzzy rules are specified as such and no adjustment has been made on them). To do this, we use a fuzzy inference system that has two inputs, one is the image gradient and the other is the saturation gradient.
The program may take some time during execution
